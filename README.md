# Nodejs101 - Created Basic Web Server Using Node.js
####Created server.js file to run from terminal
####Opened port 8000, to run localhost8000 inside the browser, inside more practice folder opened port 8500
####In server.js, instructed node to load indexPageHtml.html on localhost8000, else a "404 error".
####Installed nodemon npm from npm store. Pretty sweet.
####Run this server from an Ubuntu Machine setup through Amazon Web Services. This was even sweeter ;]
