# Nodejs101 - Created Basic Web Server Using Node.js
####Created server.js file to run from terminal
```
node server.js
```
####Opened port 8000, to run localhost8000 inside browser. In "more-practice" folder opened port 8500
####In server.js, instructed node to load indexPageHtml.html on localhost8000, else a "404 error".
####Installed nodemon npm from npm store. Pretty sweet
```
npm install nodemon
```
####"more-practice" folder contains example to load multiple .html files
####Run this server from an Ubuntu Machine setup through Amazon Web Services. This was even sweeter ;]
