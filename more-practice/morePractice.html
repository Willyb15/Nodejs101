		<h1>This is more html Practice</h1>
		<h2>Here is some more content</h2>
			<p>I told node to load this HTML page if "ip address" + "8500"(port I told node to listen on) + "/" is typed into url bar</p>
			<p>Here we have http://54.183.157.77:8500/</p>
			<p>Ran command "node server.js" file through terminal inside an Ubuntu Server setup through Amazon Web Services with Node installed
			<p>In the terminal gave command "sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8500"</p>
			<p>This directs HTTP traffic coming in on port 80, to port 8500<p>
			<p>I'm running a web server. #suckit</p>
			<p>type "/2" at the end of url to have node load up another html page I created.</p>
